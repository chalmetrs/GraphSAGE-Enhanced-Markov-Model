Augmenting Space Syntax with Human-Centric Features:  A GraphSAGE-Enhanced Markov Model for Urban Path Prediction

Abstract

Space Syntax has long provided a framework for analysing urban networks through topological connectivity, yet its traditional reliance on geometric configurations often overlooks human-centric factors influencing movement. This project proposes a machine learning model that augments Space Syntax methodology by integrating environmental, cultural, and infrastructural features—such as road incline, memorial presence, and tree coverage density—to predict road usage likelihood better. We introduce a hybrid framework combining a Markov chain to model path decisions and GraphSAGE, a graph neural network, to learn from heterogeneous spatial data. Trained on UK road networks across diverse cities, our model synthesises datasets, including Space Syntax integration value, to quantify how humanistic features alter route selection. Results demonstrate deviations from Space Syntax centrality measures, revealing that factors like pedestrian-friendly green spaces and landmarks shape navigational behavior. Our neural network pipeline demonstrates the potential for generalising to unseen spatial networks, enabling transferable prediction models for Space Syntax-derived metrics. Challenges such as data overlap and model interpretability are discussed, alongside solutions for minimising spatial bias.
